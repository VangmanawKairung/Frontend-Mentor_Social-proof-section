## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Component
- Dynamic Rendering with React
- Key Prop Usage
- Accessibility Techniques
- Destructuring and clean code
- Reusable JSX
- Custom Assets
- SCSS (Sass CSS)
- Project File structure
- Media Queries

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I improved my skills in semantic HTML5, React for modular components, and SCSS for maintainable styling. I learned to use Flexbox for layouts, a mobile-first workflow for responsiveness, and ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility. This experience sharpened my coding practices and attention to detail.

### Continued development

I plan to refine my skills by exploring more advanced React features like hooks and context for state management. I aim to enhance my accessibility knowledge by implementing more inclusive designs and testing with screen readers. Additionally, I want to deepen my understanding of performance optimization, responsive design using CSS Grid, and creating smoother user interactions with animations and transitions.
